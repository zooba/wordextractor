Word Extractor allows you to write, review and edit your documents using Microsoft Word 2007 (or later), complete with spelling and grammar checking, trackable changes and navigation features, before using LaTeX to perform typesetting.

Only a subset of Word's formatting features are carried through to the LaTeX document - the emphasis is on content - but most labels and cross-references are retained.

The application is currently "me"-ware, as in, it performs the minimum required functionality for the purposes of the author. It is published here to encourage others to use and improve.

See the [Usage](Usage.md) page for information on usage (surprise, surprise).

Prerequisites for this program include:

  * [.NET Framework 4.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=186913)
  * [Microsoft Word 2007 or later](http://office.microsoft.com/en-au/word/)
  * A LaTeX distribution, such as [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/)
